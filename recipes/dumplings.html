  <h2>Homemade Dumplings</h2>
  <h3>What Are Dumplings?</h3>
  <p>A dumpling is a small mass of dough that can be boiled, fried, baked, or steamed. There are a ton of dumpling varieties out there, from pork- and cabbage-filled Chinese dumplings to cheesy Polish dumplings.</p>
  <p>These boiled drop dumplings, which are popular in the U.S., are often paired with chicken and broth to create a popular comfort food called <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipes/14723/soups-stews-and-chili/soup/chicken-soup/chicken-and-dumplings/" target="_blank">chicken and dumplings.</a></p>
  <p>They're prepared by dropping spoonfuls of dough into a pot of boiling soup or stew. The starch in the dumplings thickens the broth, resulting in a rich stew that's impossible to resist.</p>
